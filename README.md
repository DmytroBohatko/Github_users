To install this application enter in terminal following commands

`cd Github_users`

`npm install`

To launch application enter in terminal

`npm start`

It is my test project, which I made long time age just to test an "axios" API call. Because it is small, all code is in the App.js file
When you will launch it you will see input and list of usernames to the left. You can enter only nicknames that are in that list, otherwise, it returns nothing

Thank you for your attention
